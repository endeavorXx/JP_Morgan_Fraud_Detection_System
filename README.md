This Project Utilizes JP Morgan synthetic data-set,provided by JP Morgan for use of research purposes only. This Project uses different Machine learning approaches Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XG Boost, Isolation Forests, Local Outlier Factor(LOF) Algorithm to train different models. Assess the model based on different metrics F1 Score, Precision, Accuracy, AUC-ROC.
