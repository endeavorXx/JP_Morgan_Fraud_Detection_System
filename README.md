## This Project Utilizes JP Morgan synthetic data-set,provided by JP Morgan for use of research purposes only. This Project uses different Machine learning approaches Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XG Boost, Isolation Forests, Local Outlier Factor(LOF) Algorithm to train different models. Assess the model based on different metrics F1 Score, Precision, Accuracy, AUC-ROC. 


### For AI models to be effective at demonstrating human behavior in business scenarios, they need to be trained on large quantities of data that are representative of reality. The financial services industry generates large amounts of data which could be very beneficial, but such data is often not available for use. This poses a fundamental challenge for researchers and developers.
