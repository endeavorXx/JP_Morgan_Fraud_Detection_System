### This Project Utilizes the JP Morgan synthetic data set provided by JP Morgan for the use of research purposes only. This Project uses different Machine learning approaches, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XG Boost, Isolation Forests, and Algorithms, to train different models. Assess the model based on different metrics, such as F1 Score, Precision, Accuracy, and AUC-ROC. 


**` For AI models to be effective at demonstrating human behavior in business scenarios, they need to be trained on large quantities of data representative of reality. The financial services industry generates large amounts of data, which could be very beneficial.`**
